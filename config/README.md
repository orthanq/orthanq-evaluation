This workflow requires the `config/alleles.tsv` sheet to be filled out with the names of HLA types as adopted by [IPD-IMGT/HLA](https://github.com/ANHIG/IMGTHLA/blob/Latest/hla_gen.fasta), e.g. HLA12345, together with the requested fractions of them. 
Please note that fractions should sum up to 1.00.
