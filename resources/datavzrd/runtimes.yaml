      ## Runtime performances
      Measurements for maximum memory usage and runtimes for all evaluated tools, Orthanq, Optitype, HLA-LA and arcasHLA for samples belonging to 1000 Genomes, a trio from Illumina Platinum Genomes and GIAB including preprocessing steps.
      For Orthanq, there are two separate entries for measurements with and without including the measurements from vg.
      Each sample has links to the corresponding SRA entries.
