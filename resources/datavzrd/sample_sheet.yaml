      ## Sample sheet
      This table contains all samples that are evaluated as well as ground truth HLA types provided by Abi-Rached, Laurent, et al. 2018.
      It contains both included and excluded samples due to discrepancy in ground truth or incomplete truth values as it can be seen in "Inclusion" column.
      Samples/individuals have entries for SRA IDs ("Run_Accession"), read length and count information.
