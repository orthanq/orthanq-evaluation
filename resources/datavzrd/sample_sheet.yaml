      ## Sample sheet
      This table contains all samples that are evaluated as well as ground truth HLA types provided by Abi-Rached, Laurent, et al. 2018.
      It contains both included and excluded samples due to reasons such as vg related issues related to low coverage and unavailability of fastq data, as seen in "Inclusion" column.
      Samples/individuals have entries for SRA IDs ("Run_Accession"), read length and count information as well as links to the HLA predictions of evaluated tools.
